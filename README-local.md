# Build Blockchain Insurance Application

This project showcases the use of blockchain in insurance domain for claim processing. In this application, we have four participants, namely insurance, police, repair shop and shop peer. Insurance peer is the insurance company providing the insurance for the products and it is responsible for processing the claims. Police peer is responsible for verifying the theft claims. Repair shop peer is responsible for repairs of the product while shop peer sells the products to consumer.

Audience level : Intermediate Developers

## Included Components
* Hyperledger Fabric
* Docker

## Application Workflow Diagram
![Workflow](images/arch-blockchain-insurance2.png)

* Generate Certificates for peers
* Build Docker images for network
* Start the insurance network

## Prerequisites
We find that Blockchain can be finicky when it comes to installing Node. We want to share this [StackOverflow response](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49744276/error-cannot-find-module-api-hyperledger-composer) - because many times the errors you see with Compose are derived in having installed either the wrong Node version or took an approach that is not supported by Compose:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products) - latest
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) - latest
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) - latest
* [nvm]() - latest
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - latest
* [Git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - latest
* **[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - 2.7.x**

## Steps

1. [Run the application](#1-run-the-application)

## 1. Run the application

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app
```

In the editor of choice, make sure [line 8 of build-blockchain-insurance-app/web/www/blockchain/config.js](https://github.com/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/ubuntu/local-fix/web/www/blockchain/config.js#L8) file is set to `isCloud: false`. Note that if this is your first time using the repo, this value defaults to `isCloud: false`.

Login using your [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) credentials.
```bash
docker login
```

Run the build script to download and create docker images for the orderer, insurance-peer, police-peer, shop-peer, repairshop-peer, web application and certificate authorities for each peer. This will run for a few minutes.

For Mac user:
```bash
cd build-blockchain-insurance-app
./build_mac.sh
```

For Ubuntu user:

**Note: this pattern has been tested, and is working on a system with the following specs:**
1. Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS Bionic Beaver Minimal Install
2. Docker version 18.09.6, build 481bc77 
3. docker-compose version 1.24.0, build 0aa59064

 Change
[line 9 of of build-blockchain-insurance-app/web/www/blockchain/config.js](https://github.com/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/ubuntu/local-fix/web/www/blockchain/config.js#L9) file to `isUbuntu: true` as shown in the image below:

![Is Ubuntu](images/isUbuntu.png)
Then, run the following commands in your terminal window:

```bash
cd build-blockchain-insurance-app
./build_ubuntu.sh
```

You should see the following output on console:
```
Creating repairshop-ca ...
Creating insurance-ca ...
Creating shop-ca ...
Creating police-ca ...
Creating orderer0 ...
Creating repairshop-ca
Creating insurance-ca
Creating police-ca

Creating shop-peer ...
Creating shop-peer ... done
Creating repairshop-peer ...
Creating repairshop-peer ... done
Creating web ...
Creating police-peer ...
Creating web
Creating police-peer ... done
```

**Wait for few minutes for application to install and instantiate the chaincode on network**

Check the status of installation using command:
```bash
docker logs web
```
On completion, you should see the following output on console:
```
> blockchain-for-insurance@2.1.0 serve /app
> cross-env NODE_ENV=production&&node ./bin/server

/app/app/static/js

üö®üö®At this point, if you run into any errors, please check the troubleshooting section at the 
bottom of the page for 
common fixes! This is likely due to a difference in Ubuntu, Docker, or Docker-compose version.üö®üö®

The home page shows the participants (Peers) in the network. You can see that there is an Insurance, Repair Shop, Police and Shop Peer implemented. They are the participants of the network.

![Blockchain Insurance](images/home.png)

Imagine being a consumer (hereinafter called ‚ÄúBiker‚Äù) that wants to buy a phone, bike or Ski. By clicking on the ‚ÄúGo to the shop‚Äù section, you will be redirected to the shop (shop peer) that offers you the following products.

![Customer Shopping](images/Picture1.png)

You can see the three products offered by the shop(s) now. In addition, you have insurance contracts available for them. In our scenario, you are an outdoor sport enthusiast who wants to buy a new Bike. Therefore, you‚Äôll click on the Bike Shop section.

![Shopping](images/Picture2.png)

In this section, you are viewing the different bikes available in the store. You can select within four different Bikes. By clicking on next you‚Äôll be forwarded to the next page which will ask for the customer‚Äôs personal data.

![Bike Shop](images/Picture3.png)

You have the choice between different insurance contracts that feature different coverage as well as terms and conditions. You are required to type-in your personal data and select a start and end date of the contract. Since there is a trend of short-term or event-driven contracts in the insurance industry you have the chance to select the duration of the contract on a daily basis. The daily price of the insurance contract is being calculated by a formula that had been defined in the chaincode. By clicking on next you will be forwarded to a screen that summarizes your purchase and shows you the total sum.

![Bike Insurance](images/Picture4.png)

The application will show you the total sum of your purchase. By clicking on ‚Äúorder‚Äù you agree to the terms and conditions and close the deal (signing of the contract). In addition, you‚Äôll receive a unique username and password. The login credentials will be used once you file a claim.  A block is being written to the Blockchain.

>note You can see the block by clicking on the black arrow on the bottom-right.

![Bike Insurance](images/Picture5.png)

Login credentials. Block written to the chain.

![Login Credentials](images/Picture6.png)

Once an incident has happened the Biker can file a claim on his own by selecting the ‚Äúclaim Self-Service‚Äù tab.

![Claim Service](images/Picture61.png)

The Biker will be asked to login by using the credentials that had been given to him before.

![Login](images/Picture7.png)

He can file a new claim by selecting the tab shown above.

![File Claim](images/Picture8.png)

The Biker can briefly describe the damage on his bike and/or select whether it has been stolen. In case the Bike has been stolen the claim will be processed through the police who has to confirm or deny the theft (option 1). In case there was just a damage the claim will be processed through the repair shop (option 2). In the following section, we will start with option 1.

![Claim Description](images/Picture9.png)

**Option 1**

Once the Biker has submitted the claim it will be shown in the box marked in red. Furthermore, another block is being written to the chain.
![Claim Block](images/Picture10.png)

The Biker can also view the active claims. **Note:** You may need to re-log into Claims Processing to see the new active claim.

![Active Claims](images/Picture11.png)

By selecting ‚Äúclaim processing‚Äù the Insurance company can view all active claims that have not been processed yet. A clerk can decide on the claims in this view. Since we are still looking at option 1 the theft has to be confirmed or denied by the police. Therefore, the insurance company can only reject the claim at this point in stage.

![Claim Processing](images/Picture12.png)

The Police Peer can view the claims that include theft. In case the bike has been reported stolen they can confirm the claim and include a file reference number. In case no theft has been reported they can reject the claim and it will not be processed.

![Police Peer](images/Picture13.png)

Let‚Äôs assume the Biker did not rip-off the insurance company and has reported the bike as stolen. The police will confirm the claim which results in another Block being written to the chain.

![Police Transaction](images/Picture14.png)

Going back to the ‚Äúclaim processing‚Äù tab you can see that the insurance company has the option to reimburse the claim now because the police had confirmed that the bike has been stolen. Block is being written to the chain

![Claim Processing](images/Picture15.png)

The Biker can see the new status of his claim which changed to reimbursed.

![User login](images/Picture16.png)

**Option 2**

Option 2 covers the case of an accident.

![Accident](images/Picture17.png)

The insurance ‚Äúclaim processing‚Äù tab shows the unprocessed claims. A clerk can choose between three options on how to process the claim. ‚ÄúReject‚Äù will stop the claim process whereas ‚Äúreimburse‚Äù leads directly to the payment to the customer. In case something needs to be repaired the insurance company has the option to select ‚Äúrepair‚Äù. This will forward the claim to a repair shop and will generate a repair order. A block is being written to the chain.

![Claim Processing](images/Picture18.png)

The Repair Shop will get a message showing the repair order. Once they‚Äôve done the repair works the repair shop can mark the order as completed. Afterwards, the insurance company will get a message to proceed the payment to the repair shop. a block is being written to the chain

![Reapir Shop](images/Picture19.png)

The Biker can see in his ‚Äúclaim self-service‚Äù tab that the claim has been resolved and the bike was repaired by the shop.

![Claim Status](images/Picture20.png)

The insurance company has the option to activate or deactivate certain contracts. This does not mean that contracts that have already been signed by customers will be no longer valid. It just does not allow new signings for these types of contracts. In addition, the insurance company has the possibility to create new contract templates that have different terms and conditions and a different pricing.  Any transaction will result in a block being written to the chain.

Following is a list of additional blockchain resources:
* [Fundamentals of IBM Blockchain](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/what-is-blockchain)
* [Hyperledger Fabric Documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/)
* [Hyperledger Fabric code on GitHub](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric)

## Troubleshooting

If you see any errors, before re running the build script, make sure to clean your system:


* Run `clean.sh` to remove the docker images and containers for the insurance network.
```bash
./clean.sh
```

Next, if you see the following error: 

```Peer joined default channel
Connecting and Registering Block Events
Chaincode is not installed, attempting installation...
Base container image present.
Successfully installed chaincode on the default channel.
Fatal error instantiating chaincode on some(all) peers!
Error: Proposal rejected by some (all) of the peers: Error: error starting container: error starting container: API error (404): network build-blockchain-insurance-app_default not found
    at /app/www/blockchain/utils.js:252:15
```

Go ahead and update the follwing line in the [peer-base.yaml file](https://github.com/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/peer-base.yaml#L7)

It should now read:
```yaml
   - CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE=buildblockchaininsuranceapp_default
```

I.e. the whole `peer-base.yaml` file should look like the following:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  peer-base:
    environment:
    - CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock
    - CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE=buildblockchaininsuranceapp_default
    - CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG
    - CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true
    - CORE_PEER_ENDORSER_ENABLED=true
    - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_USELEADERELECTION=true
    - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=false
    - CORE_PEER_PROFILE_ENABLED=true
    - CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/peer/crypto/msp
    - CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/peer/crypto/tls/server.crt
    - CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/peer/crypto/tls/server.key
    - CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/peer/crypto/tls/ca.crt
    working_dir: /peer
    command: peer node start
    volumes:
    - /var/run/:/host/var/run/
```

Now, try and re-run the build script. If you get the following error after changing the 
`peer-base.yaml` file, you may need to change the [Dockerfile in the /web directory](https://github.com/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/web/Dockerfile).

If you get this error:

```
Peer joined default channel
Connecting and Registering Block Events
Chaincode is not installed, attempting installation...
Base container image present.
Successfully installed chaincode on the default channel.
2019-06-18T17:56:22.641Z - error: [Peer.js]: sendProposal - timed out after:45000

at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:188:7)
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
```

Go ahead and change the Dockerfile in the /web directory to the following:

```Docker
FROM docker.io/library/node:8.9.0
ENV NODE_ENV production
ENV PORT 3000
ENV DOCKER_SOCKET_PATH /host/var/run/docker.sock
ENV DOCKER_CCENV_IMAGE hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:latest
RUN mkdir /app
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm i && npm i --only=dev \
&& npm run build \
&& npm prune
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "serve"]
```

Go ahead and run the ./clean script, and then docker login, and then try and run the 
./build_ubuntu script again. For more info, refer to this issue: https://github.com/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/issues/79
